*there must be an easier implementation than a vue app...*

- d3?
- see what's discussed [here](http://jsdatav.is/intro.html)
- [this](https://worldmentalcalculation.com/currency-math-rules-generator/) is a cool starting point for currency conversion tricks...
- tried Vue, with d3js as well as [Vuesalize](https://github.com/haroutboujakjian/Vuesalize). Absolutely no fun.
- use direct svg manipulation?
