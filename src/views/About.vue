  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">FAQ</h2>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Are you tracking data?</h3>
  <p>
    I only track anonymous page views with the privacy-friendly <em>GoatCounter</em>.

    However, I use third-party services like the embedded YouTube videos â€” check their privacy policy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Is this a commercial site?</h3>
  <p>
    No. I'm a random guy interested in stretching exercises. There is nothing to buy here.
    However, exercises are linked from third parties, and I cannot speak for them.

  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">How can I contact you?</h3>
  <p>
    You can shoot me an email at <em>stretch(at)koljapluemer.com</em>. I'm happy about feedback, suggestions, and corrections.
