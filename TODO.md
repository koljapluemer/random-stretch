## Should

- find a consistent visual language for the svg thing, and implement it
- needs a setting for reasonable range of value
- should be bidirectional
- should not be just a random number, should pick random modes first (like "sub 1", "1-10", "10-100")
    - ideally also pick specific ones like 'contains 0', or 'super-even nrs like 10000' (or stuff like 9.99)

## Could

- really could use some cute animations and other visual feedback to show whether you're improving, a calculation was good, etc
- expand this to a "math intuition" trainer?
